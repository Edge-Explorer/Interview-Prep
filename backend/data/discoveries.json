Without further information, the geographic location cannot be determined, so the search query focuses on general interview experiences.",

            "CRITIC REJECTION: Okay, let's review the generated Interview Profile for Wabtec, focusing on the provided checklist.\n\n**1. Hallucination Check:**\n\n*   Wabtec *is* technically a technology company, but it's primarily in the *railroad and transportation* industry, not pure-play tech. The AI startup aspect tempers this, so it's not a blatant hallucination, but it needs careful consideration. The profile correctly identifies this nuanced situation.\n\n**2. Industry Match:**\n\n*   The interview style generally matches the \"tech\" industry, especially the descriptions for Technical Screening and Technical Interview. The mention of coding exercises, LeetCode, and domain-specific (AI/ML) questions aligns with typical tech interviews.\n\n**3. Grounding:**\n\n*   The profile makes some grounded assumptions (\"Innovation (implied due to AI startup context)\"), which is good. It also correctly points out areas needing further research (size, interview count, process duration). The interview style and questions feel plausible, but their presence in the profile depends on whether the research data specifically called these rounds out. The 30-minute interview duration needs to be validated against actual data, it is stated to be from the data, so its presence may signal hallucination.\n\n**4. Cross-Continental Hallucination:**\n\n*   Not apparent from the information provided.\n\n**Applying the FATAL REJECTION RULE:**\n\n*   Wabtec is *not* a non-tech company. It's a transportation technology company with an AI startup component. The presence of \"LeetCode\" and \"Coding Test\" is *potentially* justifiable due to the AI startup aspect. It's NOT a clear-cut case for rejection.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Corrections:**\n\nThe profile is *mostly* correct, but needs some adjustments to better reflect Wabtec's core business and the speculative nature of the AI startup's impact on the interview process.\n\nHere are the suggested corrections:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"WABTEC\",\n  \"industry\": \"Transportation Technology (Railroad focused, with an AI Startup)\",\n  \"size\": \"Not specified in provided data.

Industry Match:** While generally aligns with Accounting/Consulting for typical roles, the AI aspect skews it.\n\n**3.

Cross-Continental Hallucination:** Not applicable here.\n\n**FATAL REJECTION RULE:**  The profile presents Nexia International India as having an \"AI startup tech role\", which forces the inclusion of technical skills like \"Data analysis skills\" and \"Understanding of AI applications in business\" that are unlikely to be core requirements for *most* positions at Nexia.
